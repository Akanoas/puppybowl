# puppybowl this project has been made by 3 people, me and my 2 classmate
#we are working with the humane society to add a mini-game to their website
#The game should allow visitors to create teams of puppies to compete in a "puppy bowl"
#Someone has already built out the API and some of the front-end
#Work with your team to plan and implement using GitHub Project 
#Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, 
#then render that data on the front end! The front-end should allow the user to: 

view the roster
see a player's details
add players to the roster
...and more!
